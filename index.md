# SVEditor (SVE) Homepage

The System Verilog Editor Eclipse plugin provides a modern IDE experience to 
HDL Designers.  An IDE is much more than an editor, instantly providing many 
items that power users of editors traditionally favored by HDL engineers 
take years to master, or years to write custom plugins for.  Eclipse and 
SVEditor bring additional features beyond what is possible in these editors.

The Getting Started page will walk you through the initial setup and allow you to start using a modern IDE.
